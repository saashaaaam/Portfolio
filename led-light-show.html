   <h1> Project: LED Light Show - 7/11/17</h1>
   <h3> Saba, Jessie, and I used the platform Arduino to program LED lights to perform a light show. We used the language C in order to</h3>
   <h3> accomplish this. In order to write the code, we learned about for loops and arrays in C. For loops are used to repeat blocks of code in curly braces.</h3>
   <h3> An array is a collection of of variables that is assessed by an index number.</h3>
   <h3> Below are photos of our code!</h3>
