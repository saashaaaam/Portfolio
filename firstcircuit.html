    <h1> Project: Our First Circuit - 7/10/17</h1>
    <h3> Today, Ashley, Jessie, Priya, and I made our own circuits on the breadboard of a robot. We used a battery, wires, resistors, and LED lights.</h3>
    <h3> Before we constructed the actual circuit, we drew a diagram on paper and laid out all of the components necessary. Below are photos of our creation!</h3>
